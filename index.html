           Hello! My name is Brian! I'm an active duty Army soldier who gets out of the military in TWO WEEKS! I've spent the last four years up in Alaska as an airborne paratrooper and communications specialist. I've done everything from networking to radios; satellite configuration to freezing myself to sleep! It's been an incredibly humbling experience and I'm looking forward to getting out of the military and pursuing a career as a software engineer! The dream job is Microsoft so I can compete with my father for who had the best military to Microsoft transition!
